Overview
---
This project is part of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program Term 2. 

If you are looking for instructions how to build and setup the project environment, please see the [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) for more details.


### Project Goals
The goals/steps of this project are the following:
* Implement a PID controller in order to steer a vehicle around a simulated track
* Tune the PID controller hyperparameters either manually or algorithmically to minimize the cross track error
* Discuss the effects of the P, I, D components in their implementation


### Results

### Reflection

#### Effects of each component P, I, D in the implementation



#### Hyperparameter optimization
